‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Submissions/             # Your solutions go here
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ python questions/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Question_1_Python_1.py
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Question_2_Python_2.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ MATLAB questions/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Question_1_MATLAB_1.m
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Question_2_MATLAB_2.m
```


#### üéØ For Each Question:
1. **Read the question file carefully**
2. **Create a folder inside `Submissions/` with your full name (e.g., `Submissions/John_Doe`)**
3. **Store all your solution files in your personal folder**
4. **Use the exact naming convention specified below for your files**
4. **Test your code to make sure it works**


#### üìù Solution File Naming:
- Python Q1: `Submissions/Your_Name/Python_1.py`
- Python Q2: `Submissions/Your_Name/Python_2.py`
- MATLAB Q1: `Submissions/Your_Name/MATLAB_1.m`
- MATLAB Q2: `Submissions/Your_Name/MATLAB_2.m`


**Example**: If your name is John Doe, create a folder `Submissions/John_Doe/` and place your files inside:
- `Submissions/John_Doe/Python_1.py`
- `Submissions/John_Doe/Python_2.py`
- `Submissions/John_Doe/MATLAB_1.m`

```bash
git add Submissions/Your_Name/
```

3. **Commit your work with a clear message**:
```bash
git commit -m "Add solutions for MATrix club selection test - [Your Name]"
```

git push origin solutions-YOUR_NAME


### 3. Push Your Solutions to GitHub (Push to the main branch ONLY)

```bash
git add Submissions/Your_Name/
git commit -m "Add solutions for MATrix club selection test - [Your Name]"
git push origin main
```

> **Note:** Please push your solutions to the `main` branch only. Do not create or use any other branches for your submission.

## üõ†Ô∏è TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Problem 1: "Git is not recognized as a command"
**Solution**: 
- Git is not installed or not in your PATH
- Download and install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)
- Restart your terminal/command prompt
- Try the command again

### Problem 2: "Permission denied" when cloning
**Solution**:
- Make sure you're using the HTTPS URL, not SSH
- Check if you're logged into GitHub
- Try cloning again with: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/repo-name.git`

### Problem 3: "Failed to push some refs"
**Solution**:
```bash
git pull origin main
git push origin solutions-YOUR_NAME
```

### Problem 4: Can't find the "Fork" button
**Solution**:
- Make sure you're logged into GitHub
- Refresh the repository page
- The fork button is in the top-right corner of the repository page

### Problem 5: Files not showing up in GitHub
**Solution**:
- Check if you added the files: `git add Submissions/`
- Check if you committed: `git commit -m "your message"`
- Check if you pushed: `git push origin solutions-YOUR_NAME`
- Refresh your GitHub repository page

### Problem 6: "Nothing to commit, working tree clean"
**Solution**:
- Make sure your files are in the `Submissions/` folder
- Check the file names match the required format
- Use `git status` to see what Git is tracking

### Problem 7: Python/MATLAB code not working
**Solution**:
- Read the error messages carefully
- Check the example outputs in the question files
- Make sure you're using the correct syntax
- Test with simple cases first
- Ask for help from fellow students (collaboration on debugging is okay!)

### Problem 8: Can't create pull request
**Solution**:
- Make sure you forked the repository (not cloned the original)
- Make sure you pushed your branch: `git push origin solutions-YOUR_NAME`
- Go to YOUR fork on GitHub (github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/member_selection_test)
- Try the pull request again

## üåü Success Tips for Beginners

### Programming:
1. **Read the story context** - it helps you understand what to build
2. **Start simple** - get basic functionality working first
3. **Use meaningful variable names** - `sensor_data` is better than `x`
4. **Test as you go** - don't wait until the end to test your code
5. **Comment your code** - explain your thinking

### GitHub:
1. **Follow the steps exactly** - don't skip any steps
2. **Double-check file names** - they must match exactly
3. **Commit often** - it's better to have multiple commits than lose work
4. **Read error messages** - they usually tell you what's wrong
5. **Ask for help early** - don't waste time stuck on technical issues

### General:
1. **Stay calm** - everyone was a beginner once!
2. **Focus on learning** - this is a learning experience
3. **Do your best** - we're looking for effort and potential
4. **Have fun** - programming should be enjoyable!
