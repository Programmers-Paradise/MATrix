## üöÄ STEP-BY-STEP SUBMISSION PROCESS

### STEP 1: Fork the Repository
1. **Navigate to the test repository**: [Repository Link - Will be provided by president]
2. **Click the "Fork" button** in the top-right corner
3. **Select your account** when prompted
4. **Wait for the fork to complete** - you now have your own copy!

![Fork Example](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-23088/images/help/repository/fork_button.jpg)

### STEP 2: Clone Your Fork to Your Computer
1. **On your forked repository page**, click the green "Code" button
2. **Copy the HTTPS URL** (it should look like: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/member_selection_test.git`)
3. **Open terminal/command prompt**
4. **Navigate to where you want the folder** (e.g., `cd Desktop`)
5. **Run the clone command**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/member_selection_test.git
```
6. **Enter the directory**:
```bash
cd member_selection_test
```

### STEP 3: Create a New Branch for Your Solutions
**Why create a branch?** It keeps your work organized and makes pull requests cleaner.

```bash
git checkout -b solutions-YOUR_NAME
```
Example: `git checkout -b solutions-john-doe`

### STEP 4: Complete the Programming Questions

#### üìÅ File Structure
```
member_selection_test/

- Restart your terminal/command prompt
- Try the command again

### Problem 2: "Permission denied" when cloning
**Solution**:
- Make sure you're using the HTTPS URL, not SSH
- Check if you're logged into GitHub
- Try cloning again with: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/repo-name.git`

### Problem 3: "Failed to push some refs"
**Solution**:
```bash
git pull origin main
git push origin solutions-YOUR_NAME
```

### Problem 4: Can't find the "Fork" button
**Solution**:
- Make sure you're logged into GitHub
- Refresh the repository page
- The fork button is in the top-right corner of the repository page

### Problem 5: Files not showing up in GitHub
**Solution**:
- Check if you added the files: `git add Submissions/`
- Check if you committed: `git commit -m "your message"`
- Check if you pushed: `git push origin solutions-YOUR_NAME`
- Refresh your GitHub repository page

### Problem 6: "Nothing to commit, working tree clean"
**Solution**:
- Make sure your files are in the `Submissions/` folder
